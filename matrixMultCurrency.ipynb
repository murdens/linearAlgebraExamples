    "In preparation, for the trip you *will* want convert *all* your local currency into the currency local of the place you will be traveling to. \n",
    "Therefore, to double check the bank's conversion of your currency, you want to compute the total amount of currency you would expect for each of the eight countries. \n",
    "To compute the conversion you first need to import a matrix that contains the currency conversion rates for each of the eight countries. The data we will be use comes from the [Overview Matrix of Exchange Rates from Bloomberg Cross-Rates _Overall Chart_](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/currencies/cross-rates) on January, 10 2018. "
